# Vixel-Game
A short 2d platformer I made with a small team, my first experience making unity games. 

Feature some platforming basics:
  Dashing,
  Health,
  UI,
  Menu and Scene Management,
  Level design,
  and the ability to slow down time.
	
  It has one short level with a boss battle at the end.
